## Project AIS + Leap Motion

This Hackathon project uses AIS Northern Sea ships data which are displayed in a 3D globe. This globe can be manipulated by classic controls (Mouse/Keyboard), but also using a Leap Motion.
Current controls are swipe left and right, zoom in by "Screen Tapping" and zoom out by "Key Tapping".
